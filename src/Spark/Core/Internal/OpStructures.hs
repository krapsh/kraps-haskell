A node operation.
A description of all the operations between nodes.
These are the low-level, physical operations that Spark implements.

Each node operation is associated with:
 - a locality
 - an operation name (implicit or explicit)
 - a data type
 - a representation in JSON

Additionally, some operations are associated with algebraic invariants
to enable programmatic transformations.
